# KSPSerialIO-cross

This is a fork of the [KSPSerialIO](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/60281-hardware-plugin-arduino-based-physical-display-serial-port-io-tutorial-22-april/)
plugin for Kerbal Space Program. KSPSerialIO provides a serial interface for
KSP. This fork of the plugin runs on MacOS and is customized by hugopeeters for use with his KerbalController.

## What doesn't work?

* Automatic port detection. You'll need to explicitly set a serial port
  in the `config.xml`.

## What does work?

* Everything else, as far as I'm aware.
