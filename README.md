# KSPSerialIO-cross

This is a fork of the [KSPSerialIO](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/60281-hardware-plugin-arduino-based-physical-display-serial-port-io-tutorial-22-april/)
plugin for Kerbal Space Program. KSPSerialIO provides a serial interface for
KSP. This fork of the plugin runs on MacOS and is customized by hugopeeters for use with his KerbalController.

## What doesn't work (yet)?

See the issues list on the github page (https://github.com/hugopeeters/KSPSerialIO/issues)
